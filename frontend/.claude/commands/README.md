## ‚úÖ Best Practices

### 1. **Start with Planning**
Always use `/planner` for complex features to create a structured plan.

### 2. **Choose the Right Agent**
- **Full feature?** ‚Üí `/fullstack`
- **Backend only?** ‚Üí `/backend`
- **Frontend only?** ‚Üí `/frontend`
- **Specific expertise?** ‚Üí Use specialist agents
- **Code review?** ‚Üí `/code-reviewer`

### 3. **Follow the Workflow**
```
Plan ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Review
```

### 4. **Use Specialists for Guidance**
When you need deep expertise or want to learn best practices, use specialist agents.

### 5. **Review Before Merging**
Always use `/code-reviewer` before creating PRs/MRs.

### 6. **Reference the Plan**
When implementing, mention the plan file:
```bash
/fullstack Implement feature X based on PLAN-feature-x.md
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Rules

### All Agents Follow These Rules:

1. **‚õî NEVER make git commits**
   - Agents only implement code
   - You control when to commit

2. **‚õî NEVER push to remote**
   - You decide when to push

3. **‚úÖ Always analyze existing code first**
   - Agents study your patterns
   - Follow your conventions

4. **‚úÖ Always respond in English**
   - Even if you ask in Portuguese or any other language
   - Plans and documentation are in English

5. **‚úÖ Explain their decisions**
   - Agents provide reasoning
   - Learn while they implement

### Planner Specific Rules:

- ‚õî **NEVER writes code** - only plans
- ‚úÖ Creates structured `.md` files
- ‚úÖ Tracks completion status

### Orchestrators vs Specialists:

**Orchestrators** (fullstack, backend, frontend):
- Implement complete features
- Combine multiple technologies
- Follow implementation order

**Specialists** (dotnet-expert, frontend-expert, etc.):
- Provide deep expertise
- Give architectural guidance
- Suggest best practices
- Great for learning

## üéì Learning from Agents

All agents are **didactic** - they explain their decisions:

- **Why** certain patterns are used
- **How** different layers interact
- **What** best practices apply
- **When** to use specific approaches

Use this as a learning opportunity to improve your skills!
